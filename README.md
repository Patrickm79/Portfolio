# Portfolio

* My name is Patrick Millet and I am an iOS Developer focusing on building quality iOS applications, writing clean code, and exploring the variety of features in Xcode and other frameworks. My primary goal is to build applications and software that will help people make their daily tasks easier, change an industry standard, or make industry safer. 


* I've been working on quite a few projects during my time at Lambda School and I am really proud and slightly scared of how much I've learned in such a short time here so far. My current personal project is an app that can crunch an image or library of images and remove the duplicates. I do hope to add some networking features that can basically turn it into an internet crawler to assist people who own proprietary images keep their IP safe and receive fair compensation for their IP's use. 


* I plan on keeping this updated as much as I'm able to remember to with relevant projects and code snippets I'm particularly proud of, and by all means feel free to browse my repos or message me directly if you have any questions. Thanks for your time!
